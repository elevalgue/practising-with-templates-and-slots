# **Using templates and slots**

When you have to reuse the same markup structures repeatedly on a web page, it makes sense to use some kind of a template rather than repeating the same structure over and over again. This was possible before, but it is made a lot easier by the HTML **<template>** element (which is well-supported in modern browsers). This element and its contents are not rendered in the DOM, but it can still be referenced using JavaScript.
